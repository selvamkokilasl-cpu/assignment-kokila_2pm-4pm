                <p>cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. <br>the batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). <br>means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. <br>when ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. <br>the game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. <br>they communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p>

                <p>basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. <br>the game was invented in 1891 by dr. james naismith, a canadian physical education instructor who sought to create a sport less prone to injury than football. <br>naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a elevated track. <br>the first game was played in december 1891 with nine players on each side and they used a soccer ball. <br>the sport quickly grew in popularity and was included as an official olympic sport at the 1936 berlin olympics. <p></p>
